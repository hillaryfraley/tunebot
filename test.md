**Type of content to be created**

* Text
* Code

**Navigation**

Never a dead end: multiple links on each content piece. Always a link at the bottom of each article/content to lead devs somewhere else on the DP. Keep the narrative going.

**Scope and tone of voice**

* Pragmatic and playful
* Keep it concise whenever possible
* Check website https://www.typeform.com/ and blog articles written by our staff https://www.typeform.com/blog/
* Make every word count.
* Use words people are familiar with.
* Be clear and descriptive.
* Explain what’s happening: tell them what, and why.
* Don’t leave people wondering what effect an action will have, how something works, or what their next step is. 
* One idea at a time.
* Draw people in: be intriguing, hold some story back [for content other than References, Troubleshooting, and other 100% technical content] 
* Use everyday words: use the right amount of jargon, avoid corporate speak and buzzwords as much as possible. Be natural. 
* Remove fluff: be a helpful sherpa.
* Be respectful: we’re all different, that’s cool, keep it in mind when you type.
* Be transparent: back up claims with links, quotes, and references. No opinions, focus on facts.
* Be humorous and friendly, as long as it doesn’t hamper user goals and is humor that a global audience can feel comfortable with. 

*Example*: "Share the love and save up to 100% off your bill" instead of "Make referrals and get a discount."

**Editorial style guide**

We use US English, and our reference style guide is the Chicago Manual of Style. Here are some pointers for common situations:

*Capitalization*

Typeform (the company) makes Typeform (the platform), which people use to make typeforms (the forms).

*Headlines, subtitles, and plain ol’ sentences*

Begin with a capital letter and only capitalize proper names like brands, trademarks, unique feature names, official standards, and creative works. Some examples:

* Behind the scenes of Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins
* Using Calculator to score a quiz
* Jumping to conclusions with Logic Jump

*Numbers*

Always use digits in headlines. Everywhere else—space permitting—use one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

*Ampersands*

Ampersands are okay in places where space is precious or it’s for visual style. (Titles, subtitles, subheadings, platform copy, and style guides.)

*Dashes and hyphens*

A hyphen (-) is used to make compound adjectives. Ready-to-go checkout, A green-eyed monster. An en dash (–) can replace to in a range of numbers, to when linking two destinations, and when showing an equal partnership, and versus.
