# TUNE-BOT
Bot that recommends YouTube videos based on your mood -- work in progress

Practice project based on <a href="http://sdkbridge.com/">Peter Gruenbaum</a>'s Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/coding-for-writers-1-basic-programming/learn/v4/overview" target="_blank">Coding for Writers</a>. Starting from therapist bot code and altering to do things like list links instead of therapist responses; search entries for strings instead of last characters; and eventually add CSS.

## To-do List
Here's what I need to do next:
* Add links for YouTube videos
* Remove recommendation history each time player hits "Submit"
* Activate "Submit" when player presses the Enter key (player should only need the mouse to click play on the recommended video)
* CSS - enhance appearance
